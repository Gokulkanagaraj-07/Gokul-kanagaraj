  1.caesar-cipher
     The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique that was used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages to his allies. It works by shifting the letters in    the plaintext message by a certain number of positions, known as the ‚Äúshift‚Äù or ‚Äúkey‚Äù. The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest methods    of encryption techniques.
